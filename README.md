# rh-cli

rh-cli (Robinhood CLI) is a simple Windows command line interface to trade on Robinhood. It utilizes a more comprehensive version of [RobinhoodNet](https://github.com/itsff/RobinhoodNet).

## Usage

`rh <symbol>` to open information on a particular stock with that symbol and to fill out trade details.

For best results add the directory with the program to the PATH variable to trade anywhere you open a command prompt. 

### Other Commands

`rh positions` will return all your holdings on RH and a bunch of other useful data.

More commands will be added in the future.
